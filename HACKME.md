Zain, the chaotic sysadmin, is infamous for his messy habits and unconventional security practices. One day, he captured some USB device activity during a routine test but never explained what it was. Buried within this data lies a hidden secret—one that Zain himself might not even remember.

You've been handed a pcap file of USB packet captures. Your mission is to dig into the data, analyze the packets, and figure out what Zain’s device was doing. Piece together the activity to reveal a hidden artifact. Within this artifact lies a flag that completes the challenge.

---
If your challenge is a multi-flag one (i.e., it consists of a sequence of sub-challenges each rewarded with
its own flag), requiring a different description for each sub-challenge, then have your descriptions split as 
done with this paragraph, and the next one.

---
Obviously, for each sub-challenge, you should provide its flag value in [solution/FLAGS.md](solution/FLAGS.md).
